# Foreign-Direct-Investment-Analytics


🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Data Science Project on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analytics! 🚀

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a comprehensive analysis of FDI inflows in India from 2000-01 to 2016-17, with a focus on sector-wise and year-wise trends. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that offers deep insights into:

📊 Year-wise FDI trends: Tracking the growth and fluctuations over the years.

🏭 Sector-wise distribution: Identifying which sectors are receiving the most foreign investment.

📈 Key performance indicators (KPIs): Offering a clear understanding of top-performing sectors and YoY growth.

This project allowed me to:

Strengthen my data visualization skills in Power BI.
Analyze large datasets to find actionable business insights.
Make data-driven recommendations for investors and policymakers.
🔍 Key Takeaways:

[Insert insight 1] (e.g., "The tech sector has seen exponential growth in FDI inflows.")
[Insert insight 2] (e.g., "Real estate has attracted significant investment over the last five years.")
Check out the dashboard and feel free to reach out if you’re interested in discussing more about the project!
